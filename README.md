# ML_BasedPageReplacement

Page Replacement algorithm is essential for memory management in Operating Systems. Optimal Page Replacement is considered as ideal case. But knowing the future page faults makes it almost impossible to implement this. Hence Least Replacement algorithm is popularly used. This project aims to implement the Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm by predicting the future page faults using Machine Learning. This gives good results. But need for training the model parallelly becomes considerable demerit. Currently working on it to make it as best as possible.
